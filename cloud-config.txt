# set up mount points
# 'mounts' contains a list of lists
#  the inner list are entries for an /etc/fstab line
#  ie : [ fs_spec, fs_file, fs_vfstype, fs_mntops, fs-freq, fs_passno ]
#
# default:
# mounts:
#  - [ ephemeral0, /mnt ]
#  - [ swap, none, swap, sw, 0, 0 ]
#
# in order to remove a previously listed mount (ie, one from defaults)
# list only the fs_spec.  For example, to override the default, of
# mounting swap:
# - [ swap ]
# or
# - [ swap, null ]
#
# - if a device does not exist at the time, an entry will still be
#   written to /etc/fstab.
# - '/dev' can be ommitted for device names that begin with: xvd, sd, hd, vd
# - if an entry does not have all 6 fields, they will be filled in
#   with values from 'mount_default_fields' below.
#
# Note, that you should set 'nobootwait' (see man fstab) for volumes that may
# not be attached at instance boot (or reboot)

## hostname and /etc/hosts management
# cloud-init will do its best to set up a sane hostname and corresponding
# entries in /etc/hosts.
#
# if you do nothing, you should get the system generally correctly
# configured.
#  * /etc/hostname (and thus `hostname` output) set with hostname (not fqdn)
#  * an entry in /etc/hosts for both hostname and fqdn
#    that are obtained from the metadata service
#  * On each boot, the above will again be set
#  * cloud-init generally "owns" the 127.0.1.1 entry.  The
#    rest of the file will not be modified
#
# You can change the above behavior with the following config variables:
#  Remember that these can be set in cloud-config via user-data,
#  /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg or any file in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/
#
# hostname:
#   this option will be used wherever the 'hostname' is needed
#   simply substitute it in the description above.
#   ** If you wish to set your hostname, set it here **
#   default: 'hostname' as returned by the metadata service
#       on EC2, the hostname portion of 'local-hostname' is used
#       which is something like 'ip-10-244-170-199'
#
# fqdn:
#   this option will be used wherever 'fqdn' is needed.
#   simply substitue it in the description above.
#   default: fqdn as returned by the metadata service.  on EC2 'hostname'
#       is used, so this is like: ip-10-244-170-199.ec2.internal
# 
# manage_etc_hosts:
#   default: false
#   Setting this config variable to 'true' will mean that on every
#   boot, /etc/hosts will be re-written from /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl
#   The strings '$hostname' and '$fqdn' are replaced in the template
#   with the appropriate values.
#
# preserve_hostname:
#   default: False
#   If this option is set to True, then /etc/hostname will never updated
#   The default behavior is to update it if it has not been modified by
#   the user.

# final_message

# this message is written by cloud-final when the system is finished
# its first boot

# configure where output will go
# 'output' entry is a dict with 'init', 'config', 'final' or 'all'
# entries.  Each one defines where 
#  cloud-init, cloud-config, cloud-config-final or all output will go
# each entry in the dict can be a string, list or dict.
#  if it is a string, it refers to stdout and stderr
#  if it is a list, entry 0 is stdout, entry 1 is stderr
#  if it is a dict, it is expected to have 'output' and 'error' fields
# default is to write to console only
# the special entry "&1" for an error means "same location as stdout"
#  (Note, that '&1' has meaning in yaml, so it must be quoted)
output:

# def_log_file and syslog_fix_perms work together
# if 
# - logging is set to go to a log file 'L' both with and without syslog
# - and 'L' does not exist
# - and syslog is configured to write to 'L'
# then 'L' will be initially created with root:root ownership (during
# cloud-init), and then at cloud-config time (when syslog is available)
# the syslog daemon will be unable to write to the file.
# 
# to remedy this situation, 'def_log_file' can be set to a filename
# and syslog_fix_perms to a string containing "<user>:<group>"
#
# the default values are '/var/log/cloud-init.log' and 'syslog:adm'
# the value of 'def_log_file' should match what is configured in logging
# if either is empty, then no change of ownership will be done
def_log_file: /var/log/my-logging-file.log

# you can set passwords for a user or multiple users
# this is off by default.
# to set the default user's password, use the 'password' option.
# if set, to 'R' or 'RANDOM', then a random password will be

# password: passw0rd
#
# also note, that this will expire the password, forcing a change
# on first login. If you do not want to expire, see 'chpasswd' below.
#
# By default in the UEC images password authentication is disabled
# Thus, simply setting 'password' as above will only allow you to login
# via the console.
#
# in order to enable password login via ssh you must set
# 'ssh_pwauth'.
# If it is set, to 'True' or 'False', then sshd_config will be updated
# to ensure the desired function.  If not set, or set to '' or 'unchanged'
# then sshd_config will not be updated.
# ssh_pwauth: True
#
# there is also an option to set multiple users passwords, using 'chpasswd'
# That looks like the following, with 'expire' set to 'True' by default.
# to not expire users passwords, set 'expire' to 'False':
# chpasswd:
#  list: |
#    user1:password1
#    user2:RANDOM
#  expire: True
# ssh_pwauth: [ True, False, "" or "unchanged" ]
#
# So, a simple working example to allow login via ssh, and not expire
# for the default user would look like:
password: passw0rd
chpasswd: { expire: False }

# manual cache clean.
